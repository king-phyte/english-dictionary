## Installation

**Note: The app requires python3.8 or newer.**

1. There are a number of ways to get the source code. You can:
   - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/king-phyte/english-dictionary/releases/latest) (english-dictionary-x.y.z.tar.gz) for linux releases and extract it.

   - Clone the repository
     ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/king-phyte/english-dictionary.git
      ```
   
   - [Download the zip](https://github.com/king-phyte/english-dictionary/archive/main.zip) and extract it


2. Create an isolated virtual environment inside the directory and activate it
   ```
   $ python3 -m venv .
   $ source ./bin/activate
   ```
   Notice the dot (.) in first the command

3. If you used the latest release. Install the application with
   ```
   $ python setup.py install
   ```
   
4. Otherwise, install the requirements:
   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Some users might need to replace ``pip`` with ``./bin/pip``.

## Usage

**Note:** To use the app, it is advised that you have a __virtual environment__ active.
If you do not have a virtual environment, find out from the [installation section](#installation) above.


### Running the app
- If you used `setup.py` to install the app, you can start it with:
   ```
   $ eng-dict
   ```
- If you cloned or used the zip. You should use:
   ```
   $ python english-dictionary/run.py
   ```
   Or optionally,
   ```
    $ python main.py
   ```

### How to use the app
- Type the word to be searched for in the search bar and press enter or click on the search button beside the search bar.
- Click the plus button near the search bar to add a word.
- To edit a word, click the edit button. __(Note: currently, the fields are limited, and you might lose a few fields)__
- To delete a word, use the delete button

    **Note:** If the word you searched for is not in the dictionary, clicking the search button or pressing return/enter key will prompt you with the __fetch from internet dialog__.


- **Enjoy! 😁**

## Extending the app
The backend was rewritten with extensibility in mind. 
The default API can be found in ```./english_dictionary/api.py```

- ###Extend the app by using another data source:

  1. Write a static method for BaseAPIBuilder in __api.py__ that converts the data from your data source to the __base API__
  and replace all occurrences of ``BaseAPIBuilder.from_free_dictionary_api`` with your static method. E.g. Say you name your static method is ``from_data_source``, the implementation will look like ``BaseAPIBuilder.from_data_source``. 
  Your static method should parse your data source into the __Base API__ JSON format as shown below.

  ```json
  [
      {
          "name": "str",
          "etymology": "str",
          "pronunciations": [
              {
                  "text": "str",
                  "audio": "str"
              }
          ],
          "meanings": [
              {
                  "part_of_speech": "str",
                  "definitions": [
                      {
                          "definition": "str",
                          "example": "str",
                          "related_words": [
                              {
                                  "relationship_type": "str",
                                  "words": "list[str]"
                              }
                          ]
                      }
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
  ]
  ```
   
  **Note:** Keys with their values as lists scan contain more than one item.

  2. Write a class which implements a `get_json` method to get the data from the data source, conveniently in JSON, and replace all occurrences of FreeDictionaryAPI with your class name.

Done!

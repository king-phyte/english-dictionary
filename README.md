**Note: The app requires python3.8 or higher.**

1. There are a number of ways to get the source code. You can:
   - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/king-phyte/english-dictionary/releases/latest) (english-dictionary-x.y.z.tar.gz) for linux releases and extract it.

2. Create an isolated virtual environment inside the directory and activate it
   ```
   $ python3 -m venv .
   $ source ./bin/activate
   ```
   Notice the dot (.) in first the command

3. If you used the latest release. Install the application with
   ```

## Extending the app
The backend was rewritten with extensibility in mind. To use another data source, simply write a class to conform to the Base API
and replace all occurrences of the current data source API (called FreeDictionaryAPI) to yours. Done. Easy!

Your class should simply parse your data source into the JSON format as shown below:
```json
[
   {
        "name": "str",
        "etymology": "str",
        "pronunciations": [
            {
                "text": "str",
                "audio": "str"
            }
        ],
        "meanings": [
            {
                "part_of_speech": "str",
                "definitions": [
                    {
                        "definition": "str",
                        "example": "str",
                        "related_words": [
                            {
                                "relationship_type": "str",
                                "words": "list[str]"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
 }
]
```
Keys with their values as lists scan contain more than one item.

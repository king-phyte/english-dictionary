        "etymology": "From Middle English trien (\u201cto try a legal case\u201d), from Anglo-Norman trier (\u201cto try a case\u201d), Old French trier (\u201cto choose, pick out or separate from others, sift, cull\u201d), of uncertain origin. Believed to be a metathetic variation of Old French tirer (\u201cto pull out, snatch\u201d), from Gothic \ud800\udf44\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3d (tiran, \u201cto tear away, remove\u201d), from Proto-Germanic *teran\u0105 (\u201cto tear, tear apart\u201d), from Proto-Indo-European *der- (\u201cto tear, tear apart\u201d), see tear. Related to Occitan triar (\u201cto pick out, choose from among others\u201d). Alternatively or by confluence, the Old French is from Gallo-Roman Vulgar Latin *triare, of unknown origin.\nReplaced native Middle English cunnen (\u201cto try\u201d) (from Old English cunnian), Middle English fandien (\u201cto try, prove\u201d) (from Old English fandian), and Middle English costnien (\u201cto try, tempt, test\u201d) (from Old English costnian).\n",
